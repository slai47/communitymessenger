Stopping as there are issues with navigation library and more having to work on SMS related issues than Kotlin learning. Switching projects.

Might change projects as I've ended up having to learn more SMS coding, handling and SQL then actually learning kotlin.

Maybe should switch over to something that is more on kotlin working.

Side project to build a new app in Kotlin.

The idea is make an SMS app all in Kotlin with a semi-different design I've been pondering to make things easier for users.

Don't know how far this will go but we shall see.

Do not take this as my coding level or style at all. Learning Kotlin and very new to it.
