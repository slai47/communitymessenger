Side project to build a new app in Kotlin. Eventually will Open Source other projects.

The idea is make a working SMS app all in Kotlin with a semi-different design I've been pondering to make things easier for users.

Don't know how far this will go but we shall see.

Do not take this as my coding level or style at all. Learning Kotlin and very new to it.
